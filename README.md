# Grok Bot Inbox

**A real inbox for the mail your Grok Bot receives. Private, free, and hosted by you.**

## Why

- **Private.** Your mail is encrypted before it leaves your bot and decrypted only in your browser. The page that hosts it sees ciphertext.
- **Free.** A free Vercel project and the Grok Bot you already have. No account here, no subscription, no central server.
- **Yours.** Your own copy at `grokbot-inbox-<you>.vercel.app`, your own key, your own bot doing the sending. Delete it any time.

## How it works

1. **Import the bot template** (button above) and tell your bot *show me my inbox*. The first time, it asks you to connect Vercel (one click) and publishes your copy of this viewer.
2. **Open the link** your bot gives you once. Your inbox appears and keeps itself up to date: every time new mail arrives, your bot publishes a fresh encrypted snapshot.
3. **Reply from the inbox.** *Send with my bot* leaves an encrypted draft for your bot; within about 15 minutes it shows you a draft card and sends only after you confirm. Replies work right away, nothing to configure.

    M([New mail]) --> B[Your Grok Bot]
    B -- encrypted snapshot --> V[(Your Vercel project)]
    V -- ciphertext --> P[Browser: decrypt with the key from your link]
    P -- encrypted reply --> V
    V -- every 15 min --> C{Draft card in your bot chat}
    C -- you confirm --> S([Email sent])
```

Your link is `https://grokbot-inbox-<you>.vercel.app/#k=<key>`: the key after `#` never reaches a server and is kept on your device. Replies are encrypted with the same key, so your project only ever stores ciphertext in both directions. Want replies delivered instantly? Add a webhook in Settings (optional). Details: [docs/RELAY.md](docs/RELAY.md).

## Privacy

- Mail is **AES-256-GCM encrypted** by your bot; the key travels only in the `#` part of your link and stays on your device.
- Your Vercel project serves **ciphertext and a static page**, and stores your replies as **ciphertext** until your bot picks them up. There is no server of ours anywhere.
- Stars, labels, drafts, and settings live in **your browser only**.
- The viewer **cannot send mail**. Every reply ends at your bot's draft card, which you confirm.

Details in [docs/PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md).

## Self-host

Your bot does the deploying. By hand: the *Deploy your own* button clones this repository into your Vercel account, and a prebuilt [`dist.tar.gz`](https://github.com/mascarock/grokbot-inbox/releases/latest) is published on every push to `main`.

<summary>Run locally, GitHub Pages, bot builder docs</summary>

```sh
npm install && npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173/?demo
npm test && npm run lint && npm run build
```

[`pages.yml`](.github/workflows/pages.yml) can publish to GitHub Pages: enable Pages (Source: GitHub Actions), set the repository variable `ENABLE_PAGES=true`, and `VITE_BASE_PATH` for a project site. Pages has no functions, so the outbox and the webhook relay are Vercel only.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests welcome. Keep it static plus two small functions, keep plaintext mail out of every server except the owner's bot, and run `npm test && npm run lint && npm run build` before pushing. Never commit a real export.
